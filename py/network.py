# Change log:
#
# 2010-01-13 initial version to load csv
#
# 2010-01-14 added cell count for the original model
# 
# 2010-03-29 12:15:20 (+0530) -- shifted the original file to network_spec.py
#                                the current file will be used for creating 
#                                the complete network - more as a driver program.

# Code:

import population
