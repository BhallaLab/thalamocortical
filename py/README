This directory contains files to setup and simulate the single column
thalamocortical model by Traub et al, 2005. 

The current implementation differs from the original model in that (1)
it does not have gap junctions and (2) the synapses can be switched to
have facilitation and depression with stochastic transmission.

Running the simulation requires MOOSE simulator
(http://moose.sourceforge.net) compiled with Python support (make
BUILD=pymoose).

Below is a list of files with their uses:

trbsim.py -- main file to start a simulation.

trbsim.py -- code wrapping the simulation settings, data recording etc.

trbnet.py -- code to setup the network

trbnetdata.py -- the default network information hard coded as Python
              data structures. The final results can be tweaked by the values in the
              .ini files.

cell.py -- subclass of MOOSE Cell class enhanced in Python for easy
        loading of single cell prototypes.

The following files contain classes to load prototype cells from
corresponding GENESIS .p files and provide copy constructors based on
those prototypes.

deepaxoaxonic.py
deepbasket.py
deepLTS.py
nontuftedRS.py
nRT.py
spinystellate.py
supaxoaxonic.py
supbasket.py
supLTS.py
suppyrFRB.py
suppyrRS.py
tcr.py
tuftedIB.py
tuftedRS.py


compartment.py -- MOOSE single compartments subclassed with enhanced
               functionality in Python

synapse.py -- data about synapses in Python datastructures.

channel.py -- MOOSE HHChannel subclassed in Python with enhanced
           functionality. Exact channel definitions subclass this.

archan.py -- AR channel

cachans.py -- Ca2+ channels

kchans.py -- K+ channel definitions

nachans.py -- Na+ channel definitions

capool.py -- Ca2+ pool enhanced in Python

trbutil.py -- some utility functions.
