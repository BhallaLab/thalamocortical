# Code for analyzing the data. This will perhaps be a module with all
# the functions I develop. Currently three lines of analysis I am
# thinking of are: 1. SEM analysis (Upi) 2. Granger causality (Ding)
# 3. Ising model (Hertz) I am not sure I have enough time for the
# latter two. But depends on how much effort I need to implement and
# modify them.
