# 
# This is for putting together the lessons learnt from experiments
# with Graph as data structure to represent the netwrok.
# 
# I note the following points: 
#
# 1. It is nice to have the defining data-structure as a graph.  Each
#    node represents a homogeneous population. The node attributes can
#    store population specific information.
#
#    The connectivity information can be stored in the edges. The edge
#    attributes represent the information on the synapses. Edge weight
#    can represent pre-post ratio (no. of presynaptic cell of type
#    source vertex connecting to each cell of type destination vertex).
