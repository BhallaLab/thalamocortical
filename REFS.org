* Koester and Johnston 2005
 - Multiple release sites for the same connection have similar release
   probability.
 - Same release probability Pr at all N sites, quantal content q
   varies between sites, q_1 ... q_N. CV(q) = 0.2.

* Schubert, Ko"tter and Staiger
 - has a lot of information on connectivity, especially Figure 4.

 - L2/3 Pyramidal to Pyramidal connections
   N = 2-4
   Average failure rate: 3.2 +/- 7.8 %,    Pr > 98% for 75% pairs
   V_0 = -76 +/- 4 mV
   V_th = -35 mV
** EPSP:
   tau_rise = 0.7 +/- 0.2 ms
   tau_decay = 15.7 +/- 4.5 ms
   amplitude = 1.0 +/- 0.7 mV
   
** EPSC:
   tau_rise = 0.35 +/- 0.6 ms
   tau_decay = 3.7 +/- 1.2 ms
   amplitude = 58 +/- 35 pA


   

* Leora Sarid, Randy Bruno, Bert Sakmann, Idan Segev, and Dirk Feldmeyer
  They modeled L4->L2/3 connections but the synaptic release
  probabilities were incorporated as stochastic input, not as
  facilitating synapse model. 

  Good info on EPSP models thoough.

  L5 Pyr->Pyr depression model in terms of variability of N, the
  number of release sites.

  This does not give the quantal parameters but says that
  Pyramid-Pyramid short term plasticities and pyramid-interneuron
  short term plasticities remain similar across different areas and
  different cells.

  Makes a detailed model of pre and postsynaptic mechanisms for short
  term plasticity in cray fish neurons.

  The above two papers introduced me to the new keywords: phasic and tonic synapse.
